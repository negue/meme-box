# 1. Choose your Media Folder

This folder is used to read all the media from it, 
so that you can easily import them or just add new ones.

The folder will be scanned recursively, so "media/gifs", "media/webm", 
"media/something" will be listed.

# 2. Add media

a) You can either add all media clips from the folder by using 
Settings => `Danger!!` => `Import all files from your media folder.`

b) Or you can add each one sequentially by going this route:

> if there aren't any clips added yet

Click on `2. Add media`

> if you already have a clip

Click on `Add new media`

> or all the time, using the floating action button (bottom right +)


## Media Dialog `Add Image: "Media Filename"`

1. There you enter your clip name to see it in every config-part / streamdeck plugin
2. the type of this new clip

  See [`Type Overview`](./type_overview.md)

3. Depending on the type you'd have a filename / url
> if you choose file type the dropdown at the right of file-input will list all files of this specified type

4. `Visible screen time` is required for specific types for audio / video it is optional
> this is used to know when to hide a media clip again

5. if you already have a screen you can select the screen right here, so you don't have to do the part at `3. Add a screen` 

> link to all media types / options

# 3. Add a screen

Either on the `Getting started`-Card or on the `Screens`-Tab

Just use a `Name` to know for yourself what kind of clips should be added there

# 4. Assign the clips to the created Screen by using `Edit Media`

> Note: if you hadn't a screen before the newly created screen gets the clips automagically :tada:

Inside this dialog you can assign the clips by clicking on them.

# 5. Use this Screen in OBS / Browser

- on the Screen-Card `Copy URL` to use it in the Browser / OBS

  > Hint: when using it on a browser, to play audio / video types,
  > you need to click at least once in the View or enable it in the browser
  or enable in your browser to play media files without user events :)                                                    
  > not needed for OBS itself :tada:

If you add to OBS - better use your usual stream/screen size, and then move the visible media around using the [`advanced options`](./screen_media_advanced_settings.md).

- Go to `Media` page, press `Preview` this will trigger the selected URL targets
  
- Or: use the mobile view
  
- If everything worked out, the clip should be visible on the target Screen
