# Import / Export

Currently it is only possible to im-/export Scripts/Recipes or Widgets.

## [Scripts](./scripts) / [Recipes](./recipes)

When you edit a script and then open "Edit Script+Config", then you can find those Export / Import Buttons

## Widgets

In the "Edit HTML" View, it is possible to Import / Export the Widget.

## Settings

Currently it is not possible to export those, but:

If you see the Paths of [installation.md](../installation.md) then you backup / restore the `settings` Folder
