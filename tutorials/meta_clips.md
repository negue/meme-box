# Meta Clips (Advanced)

1. Create your media with the type of `Meta`
2. While creating your meta group, you need to `Assign a new tag` to tag other media clips that those should be linked
3. Choose your meta type:
   -  **Random**: This will trigger one of the `tagged` clips randomly, each time
   -  **All**: This will trigger all at the same time (for example: if you want to combine audio with a picture)
   -  **All with Delay**: This will trigger each item, after the set delay

4. You also need to tag the other existing media clips afterwards
